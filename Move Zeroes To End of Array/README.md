Problem:

Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array. My solution is O(n) in runtime
complexity and O(1) in space complexity.

Example:

Input: {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}.

Output: {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}.

Input: {1, 3, 5, 2, 0, 9, 0, 11, 0}.

Output: {1, 3, 5, 2, 9, 11, 0, 0, 0}.
