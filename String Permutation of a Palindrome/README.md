Solution to the String Palindrome permutation problem:
Given a string, check if the string is a permutation of a palindrome, meaning that it's letters could be
rearranged such that they will form a palindrome.  This solution is O(n) in runtime complexity and 
potentially O(n) in space complexity, depending on how many distinct characters the given string has.

Examples:

Input: aab

Output: true

Input: llah

Output: false
