Solution for the Paths with Sum problem, from Cracking the Coding Interview, Section 9, Chapter 4, problem 4.12 .

Problem statement:

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). 
Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at 
the root or leaf, but it must go downwards (travelling from parent nodes to child nodes).
